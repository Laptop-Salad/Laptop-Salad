# About me
What I love most about programming is seeing a project grow over time. I find it most rewarding watching the structure of the code develop into components that work together, like clockwork and seeing the design evolve to fit the personality of the web app. 

In addition to programming, for almost all my projects, I create my own digital illustrations. This is either through a design tool like figma or by drawing it on my tablet. This allows me to accurately replicate my vision for the project.

However, programming is about more than building something new - maintaining and improving existing code is a huge part of the job. This means being able to navigate a codebase to fix bugs, add new features and find security vulnerabilities. I find debugging tricky issues in particular to be very interesting as it forces me to dive deeper into the nuances of a certain language or technology.

Currently I am a student at North East Scotland College studying a Next Gen HNC in Computing. I also work at the Student IT Helpdesk in NESCol where I collaborate with team members to troubleshoot any IT issues students are having. Outside of NESCol, I volunteer as Web Developer at East London Waterworks Park where I work on their website and other internal tools. I also create my own projects outside of working and studying.
